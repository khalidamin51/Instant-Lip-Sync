# Instant-Lip-Sync-
A Lip Sync integration with Rhubarb command-line tool, that enables rendering the video without a video editor application

The whole idea is based on simplicity of creating a video, just choose the scene you'd like to create and the audio file and run !
Most dependencies have been handled in the code, but you must maintain the folder structure of the program.

This could help non-tech users to create a simple video without much hassle like school teachers,students and others..

# Dependencies
- OpenCV
- Python 3

# OS Supported (Till now)
- Windows

# Steps to run
1- Open the test.bat file

2- Edit the parameters to the paths you'd like to get the character, get the audio file, and finally the path to output the final video

3- If you have several videos you'd like to combine, add another parameter with the value "merge" to create one last short video and merge all videos into one.

# Notes
1- The bat files are initialized to be ran for testing, with the test audio and character

2- The character images should be named (frame0,frame1 ... up to 8)
